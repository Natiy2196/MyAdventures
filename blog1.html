<h1> Parachute jump </h1>

Three years ago my bestfriend and i attended parachute jump. It was pretty awsome. We went to Ajševica kamp Lijak. We had nice weather, sun and a little wind.
</p>
<p> We left sometime after breakfast, when my friend came to me. We only had about 15 minutes to the destination. It was very excited. We were on edge, <span>as this was our first experience </span>, we had never participated in something like this before. We wanted to experience something exciting together. We looked online to see where it was possible and how much it would cost. <br><span> Why did we decide to camp Lijak?</span> <br>
<p>Because Lijak is a paradise for paragliding and hang gliding. Excellent Mediterranean climate, which creates excellent conditions for flying for beginners and professionals all year round. When we got to the station where all this is located, we were welcomed by the guide who gave us the necessary equipment and instructions. We paid for the service and embarked on this crazy adventure. We went to the highest possible hill. In Lijak, you can go to several different takeoff points. We arrived at a beautiful, well-kept meadow on the edge of the Trnovsko forest. The height was 518m above sea level.
</p>
<p>
We got dressed in our gear and took a breather.
<span>well, let's go!</span> 
We ran to the edge, jumped in, lay down for a while, and then opened our parachute. That moment when the parachute opens and takes you up is really a bit intimidating, but then it was a pleasure to fly through the air and look at the little dots on the ground.<span> For the first time in my life I felt big </span>, it was really high. My friend and I enjoyed flying and the view. But we were a little nervous about where we would land so that everything would go well. The whole event took up to 60 minutes, so you had a good time to see the nether world and the sky. The feelings were indescribable, it was very exciting. Feeling the wind in your hair, watching the sky and the ground and good company. We were so incredibly happy at that moment. We were both so crazy and childish, we were together most of the time and experienced many beautiful things. This event was just an upgrade of her friendship. We saw the birds and felt like them that we could also fly.
  As we slowly descended, we were a little nervous. We had to follow the guide's advice very carefully, as it is necessary to arrive safely on the ground.
<span>We arrived safely on the ground! :)</span> It was one insanely fun reunion with great company. Then we stopped at the Termika inn, which is near this camp. We ate and drank something there. 
We talked about what we had just experienced and shared our feelings. It was truly extremely memorable.
Now that I have experience and know how it goes, I'm not afraid. For the first time, there is always fear and you don't know what to expect.
<span>But, it really is one big beautiful experience that I highly recommend.</span>
What do I know, but next time I can decide to jump out of a plane.
