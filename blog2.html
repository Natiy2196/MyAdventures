 <h1> My summer vacation with my foyfriend and his father </h1>
<p>
In the summer of 2019, my boyfriend and I decided to go somewhere far away to the sea for vacation. We also took  boyfriend's father with us. Because his father lives 200 km away from us, we went to his place one day before our vacation and spent the night there. The next morning we left early, as we had just under 5 hours to the ferry.
</p>
<p> 
The company was great, we had a few stops for coffee and to get some fresh air. The road was not crowded as we left quite early to avoid the crowds. After 5 hours we arrived at the ferry. <br><span>Finally!! :)</span><br>
It was already quite hot as it was a crazy summer. However, we still had to wait a while for the ferry. It was excitement at its peak. I couldn't wait for the ferry to cross, to feel the wind in my hair and the wonderful splashing of salty water. We took a look around the area where we were and had some refreshments. Meanwhile, other drivers were gathering and lining up to board the ferry. 
</p>
<p>
<span>The ferry arrived. </span> A large ship with several decks and a garage for cars. All of us unexpectedly sat in our cars and waited to board the ferry. The sailors directed us. When we all boarded the ferry, we went from the lower part of the ferry (garage) to the upper part of the ferry, where we could see the sea, the sun and the sky. It was amazing. To feel the wind and watch where the ferry takes us across the sea. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute on the ferry and was looking forward to our holiday in Dalmatia. My boyfriend booked a suite for 5 days.We all contributed money (we divided the accommodation in the apartment between each of us) stay 5 days in the apartment and give to my boyfriend to pay. When we arrived by ferry at our final destination - Brbinj Dugi otok, it was less than 30 minutes to our apartment. I have to say that from so much driving time and so much excitement, I already had a bad concentration for driving. I would just hop off at our final stop and go to the suite. But I had to calm down a little more, because I had to get to the destination safely.<span> Well, we finally got to our apartment.</span>
</p>
<p>
There we met the landlord, who rented us an apartment for a few days. He was a kind, very open man. We also toasted with Travarica brandy. My boyfriend paid the landlord and the landlord gave us the keys.
<span>The holidays can begin!! Hureeey. </span> 
</p>
<p>
We rested a bit in the apartment and unpacked our luggage. Then we went for a walk around the village to have a look and to the sea. We also saw restaurants, shops, a post office, a pharmacy and hotels. We decided to go eat in a restaurant one day, even though we have a kitchen in the apartment and bought something to cook. We also had a barbecue behind the apartment, so we also had a picnic and just enjoyed it. We had beautiful weather all day, we explored the beaches, there were many paths. You could be somewhere alone on the beach, or you could be on a public beach. there was a lot to explore. We went to bed late in the evening, because after dinner we always went for a walk to and around the sea. One evening there was a party and we went to have a look.
</p>
<p>
Every morning I made breakfast for us, and  boyfrined's father made coffee. It was nice to see us eating breakfast together. My boyfriend usually doesn't eat breakfast in the morning, but I somehow convinced him to eat then. Then, after breakfast, we toasted with Travarica brandy, I cleaned up the plates, glasses and cups from breakfast. We went to change into bathing suits and went to the beach to the sea. The water was quite cold. we went to different beaches every next day. My boyfriend and I also had some time to ourselves, we drove to some other beach destination, or his father went for a walk in the village by himself. My boyfriend also likes to fish, it brings him relaxation. We also had a balcony in the apartment.<span> I loved our mornings and our evenings when we were on the balcony talking and enjoying ourselves.</span>
</p>
<p>
We also had a friendly landlord who came to visit from time to time and we talked. My boyfriend and his dad had a lot of questions about this place. Especially since they were both here years ago when my boyfriend was a little boy. According to the boy's father, many things have changed in this village. The days passed quickly, I enjoyed both my boyfriend and his father. My boyfriend sometimes needed time to himself, so I went for a walk and a drink with his father. His father is a nice, warm person and I can talk to him about many things. Sometimes we  joke about things and I really feel good with him considering the age difference. My boyfriend has a really good dad and I'm really happy with how good a relationship they have together as father and son. Family means a lot to me, and that's why I appreciated their relationship even more. 
</p>
<p>
<span>The day came when we had to leave the apartment and come back to reality.</span> All good things come to an end. We started packing our things and clothes.
The landlord came one last time and we toasted with him one last time. We left the apartment empty as it was, I cleaned a little more so that it was as clean as it was when we came in. We piled all our luggage into the car, gave the keys back to the landlord, got in the car and drove to the ferry.<br><span> Goodbye, Dalmatia! </span><br> <span>I will always remember you. </span><br>
I was looking forward to the last ride on the ferry. There was no crowd, it went through nicely. Before we got to the ferry, there were car washes and they cleaned our windshield as the car was quite dirty from the sand. We and the other passengers lined up and waited for the ferry to arrive. We went for some time to eat and drink. It was time to take some last pictures
<span>The ferry arrived and it was time to board.</span> I really like that the boarding of cars on the ferry is very controlled and that the sailors direct each car where to bring it into the garage, as there are lines and each car goes in its own row. Well, we boarded the ferry, now we turn off the car and go to the early part. a dreamy view of the vast sea, the last splash of the sea and the feeling of saltiness in the hair. The sun was shining, it was warm.
We let ourselves go, sat on the ferry and looked at the beautiful view. After a while, we saw our destination. We are slowly getting closer. We all get ready and walk to our cars. The ferry docks at the pier and the ramp slowly opens. Sailors calibrate every single car out and on the ferry. Well, let's go home slowly.<span> A few more hours of driving!</span>
</p>
<p>
I'm not used to going on vacation with such an older person, because I thought that my boyfriend and I would go alone, but because of the apartment, the boyfriend invited his father along. Otherwise, it was interesting, because that way I also got to know his father better.
I love holidays like this, hours of driving and then a ferry ride. Even on this vacation, we all bonded more and got to know something new about each other. Each of us has our own habits and rituals and we had to adapt and make compromises. We only had one key to the apartment, so we had to be in contact if we weren't all together. It was truly an unforgettable experience.
